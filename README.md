# Airline-Delay

Downloaded Airline delay data from http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html.This relates to airline delay in the year 2008.
This is a 133 MB file with 31 Variables and 953104 Observations . This contains data from the year 2008 on Airline Flight numbers , their Arirval Delay , Departure Delay and Origin Cities , Destination Cities .Over the course of this project I have merged different Excel sheets to fetch data on Airport Codes , Origin City Airport Codes to get a complete picture and subsequently worked on the same to derive meaningful information.
